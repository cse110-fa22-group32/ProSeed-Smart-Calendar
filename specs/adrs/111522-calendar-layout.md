# Calendar View

## Context and Problem Statement

How would the calendar view look like?


## Considered Options

- Originally if you do not click on a day, it jsut looks like a normal calendar no events nor days will be shown, image can be shown in the full view wireframe.
- Once you click on a day the calendar will be compressed horrizontally. A little box will appear on the left of the calendar which will show all the events of the to-do list in the calendar which we call this "day-view


## Decision Outcome

Once you click on a day the calendar will be compressed horrizontally. A little box will appear on the left of the calendar which will show all the events of the to-do list in the calendar which we call this "day-view
