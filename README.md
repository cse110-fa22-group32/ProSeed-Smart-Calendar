To sign in, please use the username: `skhaw@udsd.edu` and password: `This123`. From middle-ground.html you will be able to either create a new calendar or import a calendar yourself. You can download this [**file**](/source/assets/temp_/testing_calendar.json) as a test calendar json file to use and load. The rest should be pretty familiar. Enjoy!

We are creating a productivity app that combines a calendar and a to-do list into one! It works fully offline and also creates an exportable file that you can send to someone else so they can see/modify their own version of their calendar as well!
